Stack: React (TypeScript) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, PostgreSQL database.
Architecture rules are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), and the AI declaration policy in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Getting started

Commands assume macOS or Linux; Windows differences are noted.

### 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Check with | Needed for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Git | any | `git --version` | everything |
| Python | 3.12 | `python3.12 --version` | running the backend without Docker, tests, linting |
| Node.js | 22 | `node --version` | running the frontend without Docker, frontend and e2e tests |
| Docker Desktop | any recent | `docker --version` | running with Docker |
| PostgreSQL | 16 | `psql --version` | running the backend without Docker |

On macOS with Homebrew: `brew install python@3.12 postgresql@16`. Docker Desktop is available
from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### 2. Get the code and create your `.env`

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabrielshufelt/powr.git
cd powr
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` holds your local settings and is never committed. The defaults work as-is; every
variable is explained in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

### 3. Run the backend

Choose one of the two options.

#### Option A: with Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL on port 5432, the backend on port 8000 and the frontend on port 5173,
reloading when you edit code. Stop with `Ctrl+C`, then `docker compose down`. To reset the
database completely (deletes all local data), run `docker compose down -v`. After changing
frontend dependencies, run `docker compose up --build -V` so the container reinstalls them.

#### Option B: directly on your machine

This is also the setup needed to run tests, linting and type checks locally.

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

   Your prompt now starts with `(.venv)`. **Run `source .venv/bin/activate` again in every
   new terminal** before using `uvicorn`, `pytest`, `ruff` or `mypy`.

2. Start PostgreSQL (`brew services start postgresql@16` on macOS), then create the user and
   database that `.env` expects:

   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE USER powr_user WITH PASSWORD 'powr_password';"
   psql -h localhost -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE powr_dev OWNER powr_user;"
   ```

   If `psql` asks for a password you don't know, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

3. Start the backend from `backend/`, with the virtual environment active:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   It reads its settings from the `.env` file in the repository root.

4. In another terminal, start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   npm run dev
   ```

### 4. Verify it works

With the backend running, open a second terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The expected response is `{"status": "ok", "database": "ok"}`. If you get
`{"status": "degraded", "database": "unavailable"}` (HTTP 503), the backend is running but
cannot reach PostgreSQL; see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

Interactive API documentation is at <http://localhost:8000/docs>, and the frontend is at
<http://localhost:5173>.

### E2E Tests
To run the end-to-end tests, from the root directory (the first three commands are needed once):
```bash
npm ci
npm ci --prefix frontend
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:e2e
```
Playwright starts the frontend dev server on <http://localhost:5173>, or reuses one that is already
running (for example from `docker compose up`).

### Frontend Tests and code quality
Run from `frontend/` after `npm ci`. CI runs the same checks.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Runs the unit tests |
| `npm run lint` | Lints with ESLint |
| `npx tsc -b` | Type checks |

### Backend Tests and code quality

Run from `backend/` with the virtual environment active. CI runs the same checks, so a pull
request passes CI if they pass locally.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pytest` | Runs all tests |
| `ruff check .` | Lints for bugs, unused code, import order and complexity limits |
| `ruff format --check .` | Checks formatting (`ruff format .` fixes it) |
| `mypy` | Checks type hints in strict mode |
| `python ../scripts/check_headers.py` | Checks the Source-File AI Declaration of every applicable file (see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)) |

Tests are split into `tests/unit/` (no database needed) and `tests/integration/` (real
PostgreSQL connections). The test that needs a running database is **skipped** unless
`DATABASE_URL` is set in your shell, as it is in CI:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://powr_user:powr_password@localhost:5432/powr_dev pytest
```

### Logging

Logging is configured once at startup in `backend/app/core/logging_config.py`. In any module,
create a logger named after the module and use it instead of `print`:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info("Imported %d orders for restaurant %s", count, restaurant_id)
```

- Pick the method that matches how important the message is:

  | Method | Use it for |
  |---|---|
  | `logger.debug(...)` | Detail that only helps while developing or debugging |
  | `logger.info(...)` | Normal events worth recording, e.g. a sync finished |
  | `logger.warning(...)` | Something unexpected that the code handled |
  | `logger.error(...)` | A failure; inside an `except` block, use `logger.exception(...)` to include the traceback |

- `LOG_LEVEL` in `.env` controls which messages are printed, without changing any code. Each
  setting prints its own level and everything more important (`DEBUG` < `INFO` < `WARNING` <
  `ERROR`):

  | `LOG_LEVEL` | Printed |
  |---|---|
  | `DEBUG` | debug, info, warning and error messages |
  | `INFO` (default) | info, warning and error messages; debug messages are hidden |
  | `WARNING` | warning and error messages |
  | `ERROR` | error messages only |

  For example, set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` while tracking down a bug to see every detail, then
  restart the backend for the change to take effect.
- **Never log secrets**: passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens or `DATABASE_URL`. Customer
  personal data must not be logged either.

### Troubleshooting

**`command not found: uvicorn` (or `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`)**
The virtual environment is not active. From `backend/`, run `source .venv/bin/activate`. If
`.venv` does not exist yet, follow Option B, step 1.

**`/health` returns 503 with `"database": "unavailable"`**
PostgreSQL is not reachable with the credentials in `DATABASE_URL`. The backend terminal logs
the exact reason. Check that PostgreSQL is running (`pg_isready -h localhost`) and that the
user and database from Option B, step 2 exist.

**`psql` asks for a password you don't know (Option B, step 2)**

By default `psql` logs in with your computer's username. Some PostgreSQL installers (such as
the official EnterpriseDB one) only create a user named `postgres`, protected by the password
chosen during installation.

1. **If you remember that password**, add `-U postgres` to the commands and enter it when
   asked:

   ```bash
   psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE USER powr_user WITH PASSWORD 'powr_password';"
   psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE powr_dev OWNER powr_user;"
   ```

2. **If you don't remember it**, create a separate PostgreSQL just for powr on port 5433. This
   needs Homebrew's PostgreSQL (`brew install postgresql@16`) and leaves your existing
   installation untouched.

   1. Set up the database folder (one time only):

      ```bash
      export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
      PG="$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin"
      $PG/initdb -D ~/.local/share/powr-postgres -U postgres --auth-local=trust --auth-host=scram-sha-256
      ```

   2. Start it:

      ```bash
      $PG/pg_ctl -D ~/.local/share/powr-postgres -o "-p 5433" -l ~/.local/share/powr-postgres/server.log start
      ```

   3. Create the powr user and database (no password needed here):

      ```bash
      $PG/psql -p 5433 -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE USER powr_user WITH PASSWORD 'powr_password';"
      $PG/psql -p 5433 -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE powr_dev OWNER powr_user;"
      ```

   4. In your `.env`, change the port in `DATABASE_URL` from `5432` to `5433`:

      ```
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://powr_user:powr_password@localhost:5433/powr_dev
      ```

   5. Continue with Option B, step 3.

   This PostgreSQL does not start automatically after a reboot. Start it again with step 2
   (in a new terminal, run the `export` and `PG=` lines from step 1 first), and stop it with
   `$PG/pg_ctl -D ~/.local/share/powr-postgres stop`.

**`ValidationError` mentioning `database_url` on startup**
`DATABASE_URL` is missing or not a PostgreSQL URL. Check that `.env` exists in the repository
root (step 2) and that the value starts with `postgresql://`.

**Docker: `port is already allocated` for 5432**
Another PostgreSQL is already running on your machine. Either stop it
(`brew services stop postgresql@16`), or set `POSTGRES_PORT=5433` in `.env` and change the
port in `DATABASE_URL` to `5433`.

**Docker: schema changes in `db/01_init.sql` are not applied**
That script only runs when the database is first created. Run `docker compose down -v` to
reset the database, then `docker compose up` again.

## CI/CD pipeline

### `ci` workflow ([ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml))

Runs on every pull request and every push to `master`. A failing job blocks merging.

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lint` | Backend: Ruff (lint and format), mypy, and the Source-File AI Declaration check. Frontend: ESLint and type check |
| `frontend-tests` | Frontend unit tests (Vitest) |
| `backend-tests` | Backend unit and integration tests (pytest) with a PostgreSQL service |

npm and pip dependencies are cached.

### `Playwright Tests` workflow ([playwright.yml](.github/workflows/playwright.yml))

Runs the end-to-end tests on every pull request and every push to `master`.

### `release` workflow ([release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml))

On every push to `master`, [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) reads the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) since the last release and keeps a release PR
up to date with the new version (semantic versioning) and `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging that PR tags the commit
and publishes the GitHub Release.

`fix:` bumps the patch version, `feat:` the minor, and `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` the major.

## Contributing

### Branch naming
Branches for the most part will be created directly from the issue on GitHub, by clicking on "Create a branch" from the development section on the right.

<img width=400 src=https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-28712/mw-1440/images/help/issues/create-a-branch.webp />

This will automatically create a branch and assign it a name like `8-set-up-basic-project-structure`.

Otherwise, follow the conventions listed below:
- small tasks or chores without an issue: `chore/task-title`, for example `chore/update-readme`
- user story branches containing many tasks: `us/issue-number-and-title`, for example `us/34-new-admin-page`

TODO: detail this section once we have versioning system in place.

### Commit messages
No specific commit-message syntax is required. However, make sure that feature and fix commit messages follow these rules:
- describes the actual change rather than using vague wording.
- identifies the affected functionality or component.
- uses a clear action-oriented description.

Obviously, merge commits and automated dependency-update commits are excluded.

### Pull request process
When about to open a pull request, make sure the title includes the issue number in brackets, for example "[#8] Set up basic project structure".
Make sure you assign at least 2 reviewers, ideally people that are in your subteam, or people that have worked on said feature recently.

**Before merging**: Make sure your PR has the following:
- Approval by at least 1 member.
- All checks pass (linter, unit tests, code quality report, etc.).
- Most importantly, your branch is up to date with and REBASED on master.

Finally, do not "squash & merge", always "Merge pull request". This is for better traceability.
